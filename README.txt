#Solving the equations of stellar structure


###The equations of stellar structure determine the temperature, pressure and mass density distributions inside stars.
###They are essentialy the equations of fluid dynamics (to all acounts and effects a set of conservation laws), but
###in many cases speficided to the case of a spherically symmetric object. These are complimented with an equation of
###state, energy generation laws and species distribution laws (Saha's equation in LTE). 

###This code is a simple integrator for this set of equations, with the follwing assumptions:
###                         -

###The code is modular and easily modifiable to add other integration schemes, grid distributions, etc.
