# Type in  parameters, one per line, in the following order: 
 
   # model_name, int_scheme, grid_points, grid_dist, plot, save_data







   # model_name: string     name of the model (star, assumptions or whatever) ----> will appear on some plots
   # int_scheme: string     name of the integration scheme to be used         ----> this parameter will be passed to the solver
   # grid_points: integer   number of grid points considered
   # grid_dist: dist        distance between grid points in redefined units   ----> will be used in the numerical integration
   #Â plot: boolean          if true, plots are automatically generated
   # save_data: boolean     if true, data will be saved to a text file
