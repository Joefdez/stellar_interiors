Solving the equations of stellar structure


The equations of stellar structure determine the temperature, pressure and mass density distributions inside stars.
They are essentialy the equations of fluid dynamics (to all acounts and effects a set of conservation laws), but
in many cases speficided to the case of a spherically symmetric object. These are complimented with an equation of
state, energy generation laws and species distribution laws (Saha's equation in LTE).

This code is a simple integrator for this set of equations, with the following assumptions:
                         -

The code is modular and easily modifiable to add other integration schemes, grid distributions, etc.
